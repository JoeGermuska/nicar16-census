For the [NICAR 2016 conference](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2198/), I participated in a panel entitled 
[The way we look next: Mining past and future census data to predict diversity in race, income and aging](https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2198/2419/)

My part was mostly about implementing the USA Today Diversity Index using Census Reporter's data API.

[My slides from the session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DPNyDdZp6XwVgpkc-IrLb1Qd70Sd-j6xbeBmTujA5Y4/edit?usp=sharing) are online,
and this repository contains [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JoeGermuska/nicar16-census/blob/master/Walkthrough.ipynb) demonstrating the method in more detail.
